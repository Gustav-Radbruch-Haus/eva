# EVA - Elektronische Verwaltungs Assistent
## Intro
This app is designed to aggregate tools to interact with tenants.

## Project 1 - Rentals
To make it easier for tenants to make a request for renting stuff from the SHC, this tool will provide a management for Rentals. We start off by basic functions:
* Make a request
* Automatically validate the request against some rules. (in form.clean())
* Save request with state pending
* Create a Dashboard for Rentalmangers to manage requests and set states.
* See pending, current, finished requests
* Archive the requests

## Possible future projects
* Inventorymanagement
  * SHC
  * Bar
  * Tutors
  * Stuff
* Eventmanagement
